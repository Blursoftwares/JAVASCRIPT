## Introduction

In JavaScript, errors can occur during the execution of your code. Proper error handling helps to prevent your application from crashing and allows for smoother user experiences. This document will explore how to effectively manage errors in your JavaScript code.

## Types of Errors

Understanding the different types of errors is crucial for effective error handling.

### Syntax Errors

// Syntax errors occur when the code is incorrectly formatted. 
// These are typically caught during the parsing phase.
Syntax errors prevent the code from running altogether.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Hello World" // Missing closing parenthesis
```

### Runtime Errors

// Runtime errors occur during the execution of the code. 
// They can be caused by operations that are not permitted, like accessing properties of undefined.
These errors will stop the code from executing.

**Example:**
```javascript
let a = undefined;
console.log(a.property); // Trying to access a property of undefined
```

### Logical Errors

// Logical errors occur when the code executes without any errors 
// but produces incorrect results due to a flaw in logic.
These can be harder to detect since they don't interrupt the execution.

**Example:**
```javascript
let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(5)); // Missing argument, returns NaN
```

## Error Handling Techniques

### Try-Catch Statement

// The `try-catch` statement allows you to handle exceptions gracefully.
// Code that may throw an error is placed inside the `try` block, 
// while error handling code goes inside the `catch` block.
This method helps to prevent application crashes.

**Example:**
```javascript
try {
    let result = riskyFunction(); // Function that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message); // Log the error message
}
```

### Throw Statement

// You can create custom errors by using the `throw` statement 
// to signal an error condition. This makes your code more robust.
This helps you to enforce certain conditions in your functions.

**Example:**
```javascript
function checkAge(age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Error("You must be at least 18 years old."); // Throw an error if condition is not met
    }
    return "Access granted."; // Return success message if condition is met
}
```

### Creating Custom Error Objects

// Custom errors can be created by extending the built-in `Error` class.
// This allows for more specific error handling in your application.
Using custom errors can improve clarity when debugging.

**Example:**
```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
    constructor(message) {
        super(message); // Call the parent constructor
        this.name = "CustomError"; // Set a custom name for the error
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Error Messages**: Always provide detailed error messages for easier debugging.
2. **Avoid Silent Failures**: Do not catch errors without handling them. Itâ€™s crucial to log or display them.
3. **Use Finally Block**: Use the `finally` block for cleanup activities, as it executes regardless of an error occurring.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Try-Catch

```javascript
try {
    let num = 10;
    console.log(num.toUpperCase()); // TypeError: toUpperCase is not a function for a number
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Caught an error:", error.message); // Log the error message
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Error Handling

```javascript
try {
    checkAge(15); // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error caught:", error.message); // Log the error message
}
```

## Exercises

1. Create a function that handles input validation and throws an error if the input is not a number.
2. Implement a simple program that reads user input and handles errors using try-catch.

## Conclusion

Effective error handling is critical in JavaScript development. By understanding the types of errors, using appropriate techniques, and following best practices, you can significantly improve the reliability and user experience of your applications.
