## Introduction

In JavaScript, errors can occur during the execution of your code. Proper error handling helps to prevent your application from crashing and allows for smoother user experiences. This document will explore how to effectively manage errors in your JavaScript code.

## Types of Errors

Understanding the different types of errors is crucial for effective error handling.

### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the code is incorrectly formatted. These are typically caught during the parsing phase.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Hello World" // Missing closing parenthesis
```

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur during the execution of the code. They can be caused by operations that are not permitted.

**Example:**
```javascript
let a = undefined;
console.log(a.property); // Trying to access a property of undefined
```

### Logical Errors

Logical errors occur when the code executes without any errors but produces incorrect results due to a flaw in logic.

**Example:**
```javascript
let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(5)); // Missing argument, returns NaN
```

## Error Handling Techniques

### Try-Catch Statement

The `try-catch` statement allows you to handle exceptions gracefully. Code that may throw an error is placed inside the `try` block, while error handling code goes inside the `catch` block.

**Example:**
```javascript
try {
    let result = riskyFunction(); // Function that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

### Throw Statement

You can create custom errors by using the `throw` statement to signal an error condition.

**Example:**
```javascript
function checkAge(age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Error("You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }
    return "Access granted.";
}
```

### Creating Custom Error Objects

Custom errors can be created by extending the built-in `Error` class for more specific error handling.

**Example:**
```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
    constructor(message) {
        super(message);
        this.name = "CustomError";
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Error Messages**: Always provide detailed error messages for easier debugging.
2. **Avoid Silent Failures**: Do not catch errors without handling them. Itâ€™s crucial to log or display them.
3. **Use Finally Block**: Use the `finally` block for cleanup activities, as it executes regardless of an error occurring.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Try-Catch

```javascript
try {
    let num = 10;
    console.log(num.toUpperCase()); // TypeError
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Caught an error:", error.message);
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Error Handling

```javascript
try {
    checkAge(15);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error caught:", error.message);
}
```

## Exercises

1. Create a function that handles input validation and throws an error if the input is not a number.
2. Implement a simple program that reads user input and handles errors using try-catch.

## Conclusion

Effective error handling is critical in JavaScript development. By understanding the types of errors, using appropriate techniques, and following best practices, you can significantly improve the reliability and user experience of your applications.
