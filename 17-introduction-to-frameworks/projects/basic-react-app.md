# Project: Building a Basic React App

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of building a basic React application. You'll learn the fundamental concepts of React, including components, state management, and props. By the end of this project, you will have created a simple but functional React application.

## Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of React and its component-based architecture.
- Set up a React development environment.
- Create functional components and manage their state.
- Pass data between components using props.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Project Structure

Your React project will have the following structure:

```
/basic-react-app
│
├── public
│   ├── index.html               # The main HTML file
│   └── favicon.ico              # Favicon for the app
│
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── App.js               # Main App component
│   │   └── Header.js            # Header component
│   │   └── Footer.js            # Footer component
│   ├── index.js                  # Entry point for React
│   └── style.css                 # CSS file for styling
│
└── package.json                  # Project configuration and dependencies
```

## Key Concepts

### Components

React applications are built using components, which are reusable pieces of UI. Each component can have its own state and props.

### State

State is an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. When the state of a component changes, the component re-renders.

### Props

Props are inputs to components. They allow you to pass data from one component to another.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up the React Application

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new React application using Create React App:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app basic-react-app
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd basic-react-app
   ```

### Step 2: Create Components

1. Inside the `src` folder, create a new folder named `components`.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create three files: `App.js`, `Header.js`, and `Footer.js`.

### Step 3: Implement the App Component

Open `src/components/App.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <h1>Welcome to My Basic React App</h1>
            <Footer />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 4: Create the Header Component

Open `src/components/Header.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
            <h2>My React App</h2>
        </header>
    );
}

export default Header;
```

### Step 5: Create the Footer Component

Open `src/components/Footer.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Footer = () => {
    return (
        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2024 My React App</p>
        </footer>
    );
}

export default Footer;
```

### Step 6: Update the Index File

Open `src/index.js` and ensure it imports the `App` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './components/App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Step 7: Run the Application

1. In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view your React app.

## Example Code

Here’s a summary of the key files:

### App.js

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <h1>Welcome to My Basic React App</h1>
            <Footer />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Header.js

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
            <h2>My React App</h2>
        </header>
    );
}

export default Header;
```

### Footer.js

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Footer = () => {
    return (
        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2024 My React App</p>
        </footer>
    );
}

export default Footer;
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a basic React application. You learned how to create components, manage state, and pass props. This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more advanced topics in React, such as state management libraries, routing, and API integration.
