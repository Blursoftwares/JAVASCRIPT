## Quiz Questions

### Question 1: What does `setTimeout` do in JavaScript?

A) It pauses the execution of the code.  
B) It executes a function after a specified number of milliseconds.  
C) It creates an infinite loop.  
D) It stops all asynchronous tasks.  

*Comment: This question tests your understanding of the `setTimeout` function, which is commonly used to delay the execution of code.*

### Question 2: Which of the following statements about Promises is TRUE?

A) A Promise can be in three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.  
B) A Promise can only be in one state at a time.  
C) Promises are synchronous operations.  
D) Both A and B.  

*Comment: This question assesses your knowledge of how Promises work and their states. Understanding the state of a Promise is crucial for effective error handling and flow control.*

### Question 3: What does the `async` keyword do in a function declaration?

A) It makes the function return a Promise.  
B) It makes the function run synchronously.  
C) It allows the use of `setTimeout` inside the function.  
D) It can only be used with `await`.  

*Comment: This question evaluates your understanding of the `async` keyword, which is essential for working with asynchronous functions and Promises.*

### Question 4: How do you handle errors in an async function?

A) Use `try` and `catch` blocks.  
B) Use the `Promise.catch()` method.  
C) Errors cannot be handled in async functions.  
D) All of the above.  

*Comment: Error handling is a critical aspect of asynchronous programming. This question checks if you know how to properly catch errors when using async/await syntax.*

### Question 5: Which of the following correctly demonstrates the use of `await`?

A) `let result = await Promise.resolve(5);`  
B) `await let result = Promise.resolve(5);`  
C) `let result = await 5;`  
D) `await function() {};`  

*Comment: This question tests your understanding of the `await` keyword and how to use it correctly to handle Promises in an asynchronous function.*

## Conclusion

Once you have completed the quiz, review your answers to assess your understanding of asynchronous JavaScript. This quiz serves as a tool to reinforce your learning and identify areas where you may need further study. Asynchronous programming is a critical skill in JavaScript development, especially when working with APIs and complex web applications. 

### Answers:

1. B) It executes a function after a specified number of milliseconds.
2. D) Both A and B.
3. A) It makes the function return a Promise.
4. A) Use `try` and `catch` blocks.
5. A) `let result = await Promise.resolve(5);`
